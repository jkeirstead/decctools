# decctools

decctools is an R package that provides easy access to energy
statistics from the United Kingdom Department of Energy and Climate
Change.  It currently provides access to two major data sources:
	
  * sub-national final energy consumption data at the local authority,
    middle super output area (MSOA), and lower super output area
    (LSOA) scales
	
  * fuel mix data and the associated carbon intensity of grid
    electricity using Elexon balancing mechanism data

You must have [Curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) installed to use this
package.

## Sub-national statistics

To access sub-national statistics, you will need to use one of three
methods:

  * `get_LAD_data` gets the demands from Local Authority Districts.
	
  * `get_MSOA_data` gets the demands from Middle Super Output Areas
	
  * `get_LSOA_data` gets the demands from Lower Super Output Areas
	
For all of these methods, see `?methodname` for options to select
demands for only certain zones, sectors, or fuel types.  Note that not
all geographies provide the same level of data; for example at the
LSOA level, data are only available for domestic electricity and gas
in England and Wales.

Here's an example:

    ## Gets energy data for electricity and gas use in the domestic sector in the most recent year
    df <- get_LAD_data(sector="domestic", fuel=c("electricity", "gas"))

The package provides a lookup table to match LAD, MSOA, and LSOA id
codes; this is accessible via `get_geo_lookup`.  You can also check if
a given LAD is urban or rural by using `is_urban(LAD, urban)` where
`urban` is a set of codes defining which ONS urban classifications you
would like to consider as urban.

## Grid carbon intensity

Elexon's [BM Reports](http://www.bmreports.com/bsp/bsp_home.htm)
provides data on the UK's electricity market including the amount of
electricity generated by different fuel types in each half-hourly
period of the day.  Historic data (back to 2009-01-01) has been
archived by the charity
[Renewable Energy Foundation](http://www.ref.org.uk/fuel/) and
decctools uses their summaries to provide the data used here.

There are two methods of interest:

  * `get_grid_mix(start, end)` gets the amount of electricity
    generated by different sources at half-hourly intervals between
    two specified Dates
  
  * `get_grid_carbon(start, end)` gets the carbon intensity of grid
    electricity (kg CO2/kWh) between two specified Dates
  
An example:

    get_grid_carbon('2013-05-01', '2013-05-31')
